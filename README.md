# Video-To-ASCII-Converter
This cmd file allows for the easy conversion of .mp4 video formats to ASCII characters.
The software video2chars, which is used in this program, was created by ryan4yin and can be found here: https://github.com/ryan4yin/video2chars.

*My only involvement is the creation of this batch file.*

This project is intended to be given to a friend so that he can easily use the video2chars program to convert his videos. It is an excellent programming challenge for me as I am very much a greenhorn in programming.

At this point, I have most functionalities working, and some bug fixing may be ironed out once I find them.
If there are any errors that you have encountered, please reach out and inform me here: https://forms.gle/hTXMjCSnfYXcVyw29

Thank you for trying it out.

*Please check the releases tab to get the most up-to-date news on updates to the program.*
